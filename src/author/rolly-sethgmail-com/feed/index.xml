<p>In our<a href="https://www.oshwa.org/2020/03/05/the-open-hardware-summit-is-still-on/">&nbsp;last update</a>&nbsp;we promised to continue to monitor the coronavirus situation and to update the community as things evolved. Today we are announcing that things have evolved, and explaining what that means for the community and the Summit.<br></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>We are switching to an all-virtual summit for 2020</strong>.Â  We are coordinating with speakers to move all presentations to streaming online video.Â  You can expect a schedule similar to the one we haveÂ <a href="/schedule/">already announced</a>, as well as a robust set of online chat options for the community to discuss the dayâ€™s events.</li><li>We alsoÂ <em>still plan</em>Â on holding theÂ <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-hardware-summit-pre-party-tickets-95648185297">pre-party happy hour</a>Â the evening of March 12 for community members who are in NYC.Â  The happy hour is free to anyone who is able to attend. If you are in the area we look forward to seeing you there.Â  However,Â <em>we do not recommend traveling to NYC just for the happy hour</em>.Â Â </li><li>We continue to offer full refunds on tickets to anyone who has purchased tickets to the Summit.Â  ContactÂ <a href="mailto:info@oshwa.org">info@oshwa.org</a>Â for more details.</li><li>We will be sending full swag bags to all ticket holders.</li><li>Next yearâ€™s summit will be in NYC again on<strong>Â April 9, 2021</strong>. Mark your calendars!</li></ol>



<p>While we are sorry to have to make this change, we are still excited about this yearâ€™s Summit.&nbsp; &nbsp;We have a fantastic lineup of speakers and even more OSHWA announcements planned. While we know that many members of our community will be disappointed not to be able to see each other in person this year, we look forward to seeing all of you virtually on Friday and in person in 2021.<br></p>



<p>Thank you all again for being part of the open source hardware community!&nbsp;</p>

<p>** There has been some confusion between this badge and a hacker badge being sponsored by SparkFun, OSHPark, and DigiKey. The hacker badge will be in all attendees bags, but is not a name badge. </p>

<p>&nbsp;The Open Hardware Summit is for presenting, discussing, and learning
 about open hardware of all kinds. The summit examines open hardware 
applications, practices, and theory, ranging from environmental sensors 
to 3D printable medical devices to open hardware processors and beyond. 
We are interested in open hardware on its own as well as in relation to 
topics such as software, design, business, law, and education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For our tenth edition we are especially looking for speakers who can 
share historical perspective on the past decade of open hardware 
movement, alongside speakers who will showcase projects demonstrating 
current trends, challenges, and future growth opportunities in the open 
hardware movement.</p>



<p>We invite talk proposals from individuals and groups. Kindly note that the updated deadline for talks submissions is now <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sunday December 1st 2019</span>. Accepted proposals will be notified by Friday, January 17<sup>th</sup> 2020.</p>
